# SLCMS - Headless, Front-End driven CMS

The goal of the project is to build a CMS that achieves Strapi like flexibility and modern, simple UX with a very snappy performance thanks to GO and painfully simple working principle.

# Principles
- The CMS client is able to fully modify the pages.
- The CMS backend acts as a simple file server with authentication and possible integrations.
- Stuff has to be kept simple.
